# sandboxed-iframe-browser

User uploads html file, content is displayed in a sandboxed iframe, the iframe is like a mock broswer window - resizeable with close, minify, and home buttons on the left, a search bar in the center, and a toolbar on the right. The toolbar has an inspector button, when clicked dom elements on in the frame can now be inspected (hover - highlight, show html, etc..)
